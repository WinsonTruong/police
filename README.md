# An Investigation of New York Police Department's Practice of Stop, Question, and Frisk

The protests of June 2020 demonstrate that all across America, the people were upset at the systemtic discrimination and violence that Black Americans have been experiencing for centuries. Of the countless injustices, now in mainstream focus thanks to the Black Lives Matter movement, this project will focus on the horrid racial profiling of Black people by the police.

# Questions 
1. What are the past behaviors and trends of officers who racially profile black people?
2. Are officers actually frisking an individual based on reasonable suspicion or just racially profiling?
3. Is SQF fair? Does SQF and policing at large have to be fair to begin with?

# Data
The primary data we will be using is publicly available by the New York Police Department (NYPD). It contains every recording of stop, question, and frisk practices used in 2019. While data starting from 2003 is available, it does not follow the same layout year-by-year and often contains missing data. The cleaning process can be found in the 'notebooks' directory where there is a 'clean_and_impute.ipynb' notebook.
